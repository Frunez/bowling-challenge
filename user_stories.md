As a casual bowler
So that I can see how many pins I knocked over
I would like it to be displayed on a screen

As a casual bowler
So that I can see my total score
I would like my total score to be displayed after each turn

As a casual bowler
So that I know when I knock all pins in one go
I would like the screen to display "strike" and let me roll a second time

As a casual bowler
So that I know I knocked all pins on my 2nd roll
I would like the screen to display "spare" and not display my score till the next roll
